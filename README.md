# Database management system project
The automobile service centre portal that we built was for the purpose of efficient management of customer, employee and inventory data. Since the automobile centres deal with an abundant number of cars it’s not easy to keep the records manually and hence databases play an important role here.
The portal could be accessed by customers in order to book a slot for their vehicle service online.
The customer can then directly come on that day and can handover their vehicle after OTP verification. This is to avoid frauds.
The portal also manages the inventory and notifies the employees whenever some product like cleaning water, oil etc is below it's threshold.
The CEO or the head of the company can also track the progress of individual servicing centre spread across the nation.
For this we made different relations in our database like user, employee, service centres, inventory that stores data of all the individual servicing centres. And then made ER diagrams for it to implement it in postgresql.
